This game based on example from `Python for Kids. A Playful Introduction to Programming` book by Jason R. Briggs.

Mr. Stick Man Game Plan:

•	 Secret agent Mr. Stick Man is trapped in the lair of Dr. Innocuous, and you want to help him escape through the exit on the top floor.

•	 The game has a stick figure that can run from left to right and jump up. There are platforms on each floor that he must jump to.

•	 The goal of the game is to reach the door to the exit, before it’s too late and the game ends.
